a. Description / Purpose - I created a Django application that focuses on retreiving the desired information based on REST commands such as GET, POST, PUT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

b. Dependencies - Postman (aids with Get, Post, Put, and Delete) VSCode (used to build the application) Docker Desktop (used to run the container)

c. Usage - This program can be used to retreive, update, insert, and delete information from a database.

d. Future Work - In the future, I plan on getting my djangorestframework to work with the rest of my application to allow me to put in my models, tests, and serializers. 

e. What is your major and how this project is related to your major. - I am double majoring in Nursing and Information Systems, and this project is related to my major because it focuses on interacting with databases and retreiving the desired data from within them, which will be really helpful when working with patients and having to document things.
